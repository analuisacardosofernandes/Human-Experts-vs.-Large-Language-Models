Develop a semantic annotation scheme and corresponding annotation guidelines to capture temporal information in clinical narratives written in European Portuguese. The corpus will consist of clinical narratives from patients diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. These narratives will include group consultation reports, discharge summaries, and general reports detailing patients' medical histories, as exemplified in the attached sample. Inter-document annotation will also be performed.The annotation scheme should include labels to identify:* Events: Situations that occur or happen, or states and circumstances that are temporally relevant.* Temporal expressions: Dates, times, durations, and frequencies.* Temporal relations: Relationships such as precedence, subsequence, and simultaneity.The scheme must capture both morphosyntactic and grammatical features, as well as medical domain-specific information. The guidelines should provide clear instructions on addressing ambiguities and gaps, explicitly specifying what constitutes a markable and defining the tag spans for each category. The INCEpTION tool will be used to implement the scheme.Existing frameworks, such as i2b2, TimeML, and Text2Story, may serve as references. The Text2Story annotation guidelines (attached) can offer guidance for capturing morphosyntactic and grammatical information. The scheme should include tags tailored to the medical domain, with clear definitions for each tag and link.Provide detailed definitions for every tag and link, accompanied by examples illustrating their application. Clearly explain which elements of the text are considered markables (tag spans) and justify these choices. Use the five attached medical reports to extract representative examples for each tag and link, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the annotation scheme.
