## Semantic Annotation Scheme for Temporal Information in Portuguese Clinical Narratives

This scheme focuses on annotating temporal information in clinical narratives concerning Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) patients.  It leverages elements from TimeML, i2b2, and Text2Story, adapting them to European Portuguese and the specific needs of the corpus.  The annotation will be performed using INCEpTION.

**I. Annotation Units:**

* **Events (EV):**  Situations, occurrences, states, or circumstances with temporal relevance.  Each event receives a unique ID (e.g., EV1, EV2).
    * **Types:**  We will use a hierarchical classification based on the UMLS Metathesaurus and adapted to the domain:
        * **Diagnosis (DIAG):**  e.g., "diagnóstico de Leucemia Mielóide Aguda", "diagnóstico de linfoma não-Hodgkin"
        * **Treatment (TREAT):** e.g., "inicio da quimioterapia", "transplante de medula óssea", "radioterapia"
        * **Symptom (SYMP):** e.g., "febre", "dor abdominal", "anemia"
        * **Procedure (PROC):** e.g., "biópsia de medula óssea", "punção lombar"
        * **Test (TEST):** e.g., "análise citogenética", "exames de sangue"
        * **State (STATE):**  e.g., "em remissão", "com metástases", "estável"

* **Temporal Expressions (TEX):** Explicit mentions of time, including dates, times, durations, and frequencies. Each expression receives a unique ID (e.g., TEX1, TEX2).
    * **Types:**
        * **Date (DATE):**  e.g., "27 de março de 2024", "ontem", "há três semanas"
        * **Time (TIME):** e.g., "às 10h", "de manhã", "à tarde"
        * **Duration (DUR):** e.g., "durante três meses", "por duas semanas", "há um ano"
        * **Frequency (FREQ):** e.g., "diariamente", "duas vezes por semana", "mensalmente"


* **Temporal Relations (TREL):**  Relationships between Events and Temporal Expressions. Each relation receives a unique ID (e.g., TREL1, TREL2).
    * **Types:**  Based on TimeML, but simplified for clarity.  We will use the following relations:
        * **BEFORE (BEFORE):** Event A precedes Event B.
        * **AFTER (AFTER):** Event A follows Event B.
        * **SIMULTANEOUSLY (SIMULTANEOUSLY):** Event A and Event B occur at the same time.
        * **INCLUDES (INCLUDES):** Event A includes Event B (e.g., a treatment period includes several chemotherapy sessions).
        * **IS_INCLUDED (IS_INCLUDED):** Event A is included in Event B.
        * **DURING (DURING):** Event A occurs during Event B (e.g., a symptom occurs during a treatment).


**II. Annotation Guidelines:**

1. **Event Identification:** Identify all relevant events within the narrative, classifying them according to the event types listed above.  Focus on clinically significant events directly related to the patient's disease and treatment.

2. **Temporal Expression Identification:** Identify all explicit and implicit temporal expressions.  For implicit expressions, consider the surrounding context to infer the intended meaning.

3. **Temporal Relation Annotation:**  Annotate the temporal relationships between identified events and temporal expressions.  Pay close attention to the use of temporal conjunctions (e.g., *antes de*, *depois de*, *enquanto*, *durante*).

4. **Ambiguity Handling:**  In cases of ambiguity, provide a justification in the annotation comments. Multiple interpretations might be annotated with different relation instances linking the same events.

5. **Gaps in Information:** If temporal information is missing, annotate this as "UNKNOWN" or "UNSPECIFIED" in the relation, with a justification in the comments.

6. **Morphosyntactic and Grammatical Information:** Use INCEpTION's features to annotate the grammatical function (subject, object, etc.) of the words involved in the temporal expressions and events.  This helps to resolve ambiguities and improves the reliability of the annotation.

7. **Domain-Specific Medical Information:**  Use the UMLS Metathesaurus or other relevant ontologies to ensure consistency in event type classification.  Include relevant medical codes where appropriate.

8. **Inter-Annotator Agreement:**  Multiple annotators will be used to ensure reliability.  Inter-annotator agreement will be calculated using appropriate metrics (e.g., Cohen's kappa).  Discrepancies will be discussed and resolved through consensus.


**III. INCEpTION Implementation:**

The scheme will be implemented in INCEpTION using its annotation layers.  Separate layers will be created for Events, Temporal Expressions, and Temporal Relations.  Relation types will be defined as predefined relations.  Each annotation will include:

* **Unique ID:** Automatically generated by INCEpTION.
* **Type:**  Selected from the predefined types (e.g., DIAG, TREAT, BEFORE, AFTER).
* **Span:**  The text span corresponding to the annotation.
* **Comments:**  Justification for ambiguous cases, missing information, etc.
* **UMLS Concept ID (Optional):**  Where applicable, linking to relevant UMLS concepts.


This detailed scheme and guidelines provide a robust framework for annotating temporal information in the Portuguese clinical corpus, ensuring consistency and facilitating further analysis. The use of INCEpTION will streamline the annotation process and aid in managing the complexity of the data.
