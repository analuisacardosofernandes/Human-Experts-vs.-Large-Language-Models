 "## Semantic Annotation Scheme for Temporal Information in Clinical Narratives (European Portuguese)

This scheme builds upon TimeML and Text2Story, adapting it for clinical narratives in European Portuguese and focusing on Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  It uses INCEpTION for implementation.

**I. Entity Types:**

* **EVENT (EV):**  Situations, happenings, states, or circumstances relevant to the patient's medical journey.
    * **Attributes:**
        * `class`: OCCURRENCE, STATE, REPORTING, PERCEPTION, I-ACTION (Intensional Action), I-STATE (Intensional State), DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, PROCEDURE, SYMPTOM_ONSET, SYMPTOM_RESOLUTION, PROGNOSIS, FOLLOWUP,  LAB_RESULT,  MEDICATION_ADMINISTRATION
        * `type`: STATE, PROCESS, TRANSITION (Accomplishment/Achievement)
        * `pos`: VERB, NOUN, ADJECTIVE, ADVERB
        * `tense`: PRESENT, PAST, FUTURE, IMPERFECT
        * `aspect`: PROGRESSIVE, PERFECTIVE, IMPERFECTIVE, PERFECTIVE-PROGRESSIVE, IMPERFECTIVE-PROGRESSIVE, NONE
        * `vform`: NONE, GERUNDIVE, INFINITIVE, PARTICIPLE
        * `mood`: INDICATIVE, SUBJUNCTIVE, CONDITIONAL, FUTURE, IMPERATIVE
        * `modality`: DEONTIC, EPISTEMIC, NONE
        * `polarity`: NEG, POS
        * `medical_domain`:  (e.g., hematological, oncological, infectious, etc.) – to specify the medical area the event relates to.
        * `event_id`: Unique identifier for each event.

* **TIME (TI):** Temporal expressions denoting dates, times, durations, or frequencies.
    * **Attributes:**
        * `type`: DATE, TIME, DURATION, SET, FREQUENCY
        * `value`:  Precise value (e.g., "2024-10-27", "14:30", "PT3H", "2x/week")
        * `granularity`: year, month, day, hour, minute, second
        * `freq`: Frequency (e.g., "daily", "weekly", "2x/month")  (for `type=SET`)
        * `quant`: Quantifier (e.g., "every", "each") (for `type=SET`)
        * `function_in_document`:  ANCHOR_TIME, PUBLICATION_TIME, RELATIVE_TIME

**II. Relation Types:**

* **TEMPORAL RELATION (TLINK):**  Links between two EVENTS or between an EVENT and a TIME.
    * **Attributes:**
        * `type`: BEFORE, AFTER, INCLUDES, IS_INCLUDED, DURING, SIMULTANEOUS, IDENTITY, BEGINS, ENDS, BEGUN_BY, ENDED_BY, OVERLAP (partial overlap)
        * `rel_type`: temporal-before, temporal-after, etc (for INCEpTION compatibility)


**III. Annotation Guidelines:**

1. **Event Annotation:**
    * Annotate main verbs and nouns denoting temporally relevant events. Include the whole (semi-)lexicalized expression if applicable (e.g., "recebeu alta").
    *  For predicative constructions (e.g., "O paciente estava cansado"), annotate the adjective/noun and assign tense and aspect based on the verb.
    *  For aspectual verbs (e.g., "começar a tossir"), annotate both verbs and link them with an aspectual link (if the framework supports it; otherwise, annotate the main verb).
    *  For nominalizations representing events (e.g., "a remissão da leucemia"), annotate them as events.
    * Use the `medical_domain` attribute to classify events by their relevance within the medical record.
    * Assign unique `event_id` to each event.

2. **Time Annotation:**
    * Annotate explicit and implicit temporal expressions.
    * For ambiguous expressions, add a note clarifying the interpretation.
    * Use the `value` attribute to provide the precise temporal information.
    *  Define relative temporal expressions (e.g., "depois de", "antes de") using TLINKs.

3. **Temporal Relation Annotation:**
    * Annotate relations between events and times using TLINKs.
    *  For complex temporal relations, break them down into simpler relations.
    *  Resolve ambiguities through careful consideration of the context and using notes if necessary.


4. **Ambiguity and Gaps:**
    * Document ambiguities and uncertainties in the annotation notes.
    * If temporal information is missing, annotate it as "unknown" or use a placeholder.
    *  Establish inter-annotator agreement procedures and guidelines for resolving disagreements.

5. **INCEpTION Implementation:**

* Define the schema in INCEpTION, including all attributes and relation types.
* Create annotation guidelines for your annotators.
* Utilize INCEpTION's features for inter-annotator agreement and annotation quality control.


**Example Annotation:**

"O paciente, diagnosticado com leucemia mieloide aguda em 27 de outubro de 2023, iniciou quimioterapia em 3 de novembro de 2023.  Durante o tratamento, apresentou náuseas."


* `<EV class="DIAGNOSIS" type="STATE" tense="PAST" pos="VERB" event_id="EV1">diagnosticado</EV> com <EV class="DIAGNOSIS" type="STATE" tense="PAST" pos="NOUN" event_id="EV2">leucemia mieloide aguda</EV>`
* `<TI type="DATE" value="2023-10-27" granularity="day">27 de outubro de 2023</TI>`
* `<TLINK type="BEFORE" event1="EV2" event2="EV3">BEFORE</TLINK>`
* `<EV class="TREATMENT" type="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" pos="VERB" event_id="EV3">iniciou</EV> <EV class="TREATMENT" type="OCCURRENCE" tense="PAST" pos="NOUN" event_id="EV4">quimioterapia</EV>`
* `<TI type="DATE" value="2023-11-03" granularity="day">3 de novembro de 2023</TI>`
* `<TLINK type="AFTER" event1="EV2" event2="EV3">AFTER</TLINK>`
* `<TLINK type="INCLUDES" time="TI2" event1="EV3">INCLUDES</TLINK>`
* `<TLINK type="DURING" time="TI2" event1="EV5">DURING</TLINK>`
* `<EV class="SYMPTOM_ONSET" type="STATE" tense="PAST" pos="VERB" event_id="EV5">apresentou</EV> <EV class="SYMPTOM_ONSET" type="STATE" tense="PAST" pos="NOUN" event_id="EV6">náuseas</EV>`
* `<TLINK type="AFTER" event1="EV3" event2="EV5">AFTER</TLINK>`



This scheme provides a solid foundation.  Further refinement may be needed based on the corpus characteristics and annotation process.  Remember to thoroughly document all decisions made during the annotation process.
