Create a semantic annotation scheme and corresponding annotation guidelines to capture temporal information in clinical narratives in European Portuguese. The corpus will comprise clinical narratives from patients diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia or non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. It will include group consultation reports, discharge summaries, and generic reports detailing the patients' medical histories, as demonstrated in the attached exemple. Inter-document annotation will be conducted.The scheme should include labels to annotate:* Events: Situations that occur or happen, or states or circumstances that are temporally relevant.* Temporal expressions: Dates, times, durations, and frequencies.* Temporal relations: For example, precedence, subsequence, and simultaneity.The scheme must capture morphosyntactic and grammatical information, as well as domain-specific medical information. The guidelines should clarify how to address ambiguities and gaps. The INCEpTION tool will be used to implement the scheme. Existing frameworks such as i2b2, TimeML, and Text2Story can serve as references. The guidelines of the Text2Story annotation scheme, which I will attach, may serve as a reference for capturing morphosyntactic and grammatical information. Ensure that tags specific to the medical domain are included and provide definitions for each of them. Use the five attached medical reports as examples.
